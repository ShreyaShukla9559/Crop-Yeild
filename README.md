Crop Yield Prediction: A Machine Learning-Based Project

The Crop Yield Prediction project is designed to estimate the productivity (yield) of a specific crop in a given area based on various environmental, soil, and climatic conditions. This machine learning-based solution assists farmers and agricultural organizations in making informed decisions to optimize agricultural output.

Key Features:
Input Parameters:
Soil Properties: pH levels, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium concentrations.
Weather Data: Rainfall, temperature, sunlight, and humidity levels.
Farming Practices: Use of fertilizers, irrigation methods, and crop rotation data.
Geographical Data: Location specifics such as region, elevation, and soil type.
Machine Learning Workflow:
Data Collection: Collecting historical data on crop yields and associated environmental parameters.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning data, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
Model Development: Using regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) or advanced techniques like Deep Learning for predictions.
Model Training: Training the model with historical crop yield data.
Prediction: Estimating the expected yield of a crop for a specific area based on real-time input.
Output:
Predicted crop yield in terms of quantity (e.g., tons per hectare).
Yield trends for different crops under varying environmental conditions.
